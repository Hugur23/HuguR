# What is Stress?

![](/images/unit/image1.jpg) We all experience stress in our lives. Stress is a normal reaction to the demands of life. A little bit of stress can be good for us. It can help us to focus and get things done. But too much stress can be bad for us. It can make us feel overwhelmed and unable to cope

> **Student 1**: *I feel tension in my shoulders.*
<br />
> **Student 2**: *My heart starts racing.*
<br />

You may notice a pattern in the individual responses these students gave. They all described physical symptoms of stress. Stress can affect us physically, mentally, and emotionally. But stress is way more than just physical symptoms.

## What if i didn't feel as stressed?

Have you ever wondered what it would change for you to have better control over your stress? How would it be different? Would you do something other than what you're doing today, would you feel different?

If we're a bit honest with ourselves, it's certainly not easy to add this course to everything else that's going on in your life (school, work, friends, family, children?). You might feel pressured or overwhelmed.

Write down why it matters to you to improve your stress management. What would change in your life? Why is it important for you to attend this course? Are any of the above symptoms hindering you in life?

Contemplating this can be helpful as it may help us possibly figure out where we want to go, as well as for ourselves to remind us why it's important for us to take this course, work on assignments, and more.

Would your life be any different if you weren't dealing with a lot of stress? How would you feel in the morning or the evening? How would your weekends be in comparison to now?
Write a short text reflecting on the benefits it has for you to improve your stress management.

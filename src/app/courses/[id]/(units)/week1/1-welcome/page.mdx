# Welcome to the Stress Management Course  

## The Goal

The goal of this course is to help you know more about stress, and get insight into consequences of stress. In this course you will be taught exercises to deal with stress in an effective way.


## Researched Exercises

Throughout the course, we will conduct exercises designed to assist you in gaining better insights into your stress and enhancing your resilience. These exercises aim to provide you with practical tools and techniques to manage stress effectively.

By engaging in these activities, you'll develop a deeper understanding of your stress triggers and learn methods to increase your stress tolerance. These exercises are tailored to empower you with strategies that can be applied in various aspects of your life, helping you build a stronger foundation for stress management and overall well-being.


## The Diary

The Diary is intended for you to fill in during the day. Its aim is to enable you to more effectively map your stress levels during your day to day life. Use real-life examples when they are fresh in your memory. 

The more proficient we become in recognizing our symptoms, the more probable it is that we can influence them positively.
Keep in mind that this is an exercise; the more we practice paying attention and jotting down notes, the more adept we become at it.


## The Toolbox
The Toolbox serves as your personalized repository for recording insights and strategies that you found beneficial within each unit. It's a dedicated space tailored for your personal notes and reflections on what resonated or proved helpful during the course modules.

Within the Toolbox, you can jot down key takeaways, practical tips, and techniques that particularly resonated with you. Which you can revisit and apply whenever needed.

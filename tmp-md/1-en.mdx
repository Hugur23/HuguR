# Welcome to the Stress in Higher Education Course

This course is part of a project called "Mind" (translated from "Hugur"). "Mind" is a recent collaborative project of most Icelandic universities, aimed at supporting increased resources related to mental and physical health for university students. The future goal of "Mind" is to offer various online courses addressing the issues many university students face. Work on the website has already begun.

One of the core values of "Mind" is that students help students. This involves students participating in the design of content, aesthetics, and more. This course that you're attending will eventually become part of the online courses offered on the website.

**Trainers should introduce themselves and briefly talk about themselves.**

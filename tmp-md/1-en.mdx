# Welcome to the Course _Managing Stress in University Education_

This course is part of a project called **Mind**. Mind is a collaborative effort among most universities in Iceland aimed at providing increased resources related to mental and physical health for university students. Mind's future goals include offering various online courses to address the challenges many university students face. Work on the website has already begun.

## The Course:

The course consists of 5 sections, with the main objectives being to provide instruction on stress and teach methods to influence it.

### Questionnaires:

Since the course is in its developmental stage, we'd like to know your thoughts and how you're progressing. All information and methods used in the course are researched and proven effective. Opinions, questions, and feedback are highly appreciated.

## Objectives:

The course aims to develop an understanding of stress and provide insight into coping with it effectively.

## Researched Methods:

In each session, multiple exercises are conducted. These exercises help you comprehend and manage stress. They contribute to analyzing your challenges and how they manifest. We often work on specific tasks and build upon them later.

### Home Exercises:

At the end of each session, we recommend exercises to be practiced at home. These exercises are designed to help you apply your skills to daily situations. Introduce yourself briefly and the group can do the same. Feel free to inquire about participants' names.

We are here for you. Please ask us questions without hesitation. No question is foolish. We will do our utmost to assist you and provide feedback on your tasks if you wish.

## Toolkit â€“ The Tools

- At the end of each session, let's jot down in our _toolkit_ what we found most helpful.
- Visual representation is another way to retain course information.
- The Stress Diary, located at the back of the workbook, is for recording between sessions.

It can be beneficial to liken the strategies and methods we cover to tools. Just as we use various tools for different tasks in daily life, the same applies here.

The **Stress Diary** will be explained further later on.

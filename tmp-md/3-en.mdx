# Toolbox - The Tools

At the end of each session, we will record in our toolbox what we found most helpful during each time.

## Visualization - Tool

- It helps us consolidate and remember later.
- Easy to refer to after the course ends.

## Stress Diary

- Located at the back of the workbook.
- We record in it between sessions.

It can be beneficial to liken the coping strategies and methods we go over as tools. In everyday speech and work, we use different tools for different tasks. The same applies here.

The Stress Diary will be explained further later on.

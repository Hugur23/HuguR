# Exploring Stress and its Effects

We intend to learn more about stress and how it impacts you. The more you understand the causes and consequences of stress, the more aware you'll become of how stressful situations affect you and how you can develop a plan to manage them.

The first thing we're going to do is to complete Exercise 1 by defining stress. What's the first thing that comes to mind when you hear the word "stress"? How does stress manifest for you? The purpose of this task is to see what ideas you currently have about stress.
We all experience stress; it's a natural bodily response. In fact, it's a fundamentally adaptive response that can help us navigate challenging situations and potentially enhance our performance.

Have you ever considered how having better control over your stress would change things for you? What would be different? Would you do anything differently than you do today? How would you feel?

If we're being honest with ourselves, it's likely not easy to incorporate this course into everything else going on in our lives (school, work, friends, family, obligations). You might feel pressure or overwhelmed.
Write down why it matters to you to gain better control over stress. What would change in your life? Why is attending this course important for you? Are any of the characteristics mentioned above hindering you in your life?

Contemplating these questions could be helpful to focus on where we want to go (we can revisit this when setting goals later) and remind ourselves why attending this course is important. It's also useful for personal reflection, especially when working on assignments and more.
